# A Simple Day Planner : 
Upon page load ; enter an event at a time of the day and click the save button.
The event will be stored. This value will return each time you re-visit this tool. 
You may clear the entire calendar by clicking the clear button at the top of the page.

# Future ideas off this base framework. 
Add a day picker.
Add clear button on each row. 
Would LOVE drag and drop event tags.
